# rainefallModFramework
This is an (unfinished) framework for creating easily moddable Pok√©mon Essentials games. Right now it only supports adding Ruby scripts and overwriting files, there is nothing to handle conflicts between mods, enabling/disabling mods etc

The `Mods` folder should be moved to your project's root directory and includes an example mod to demonstrate the layout a mod should take.
