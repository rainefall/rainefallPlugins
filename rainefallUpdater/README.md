**This plugin is not yet ready for widespread use. If you don't know what you are doing, you will not be able to get it to work.**

rainefallUpdater is a system designed to allow for easy automatic updating of Pok√©mon Essentials games using mkxp-z without the need for an external launcher. It dynamically assembles (and then caches) update packages based on which files have changed between the version of the game the client is running and the version that is stored on the server. Currently Windows only.

To facilitate easier creation of update manifests it is advised that you bundle your game's assets. mkxp-z supports mounting any archive format supported by PhysicsFS either through a list in mkxp.json or by calling `System.mount`. I would also advise against one large bundle, as that defeats the purpose of dynamically assembled update packages. In my game pre;COGNITION I have an asset "bundle" (basically a zip file) for the Audio, Graphics/Fonts and Data folders, though for games that are likely to receive frequent updates I would split the Graphics folder into smaller bundles, I would bundle only sound effects and leave BGM out in the filesystem and I would also do the same for the entire data folder. Really depends on your game though, and what kind of balance between file system complexity (Remember you have to track what files change between versions to put that info into the manifest!) and data efficiency.
