provided here are examples of the two ways of defining character graphics

ANIMATED and STATIC

ANIMATED characters must have a [name].meta file and a [name]_main.png file.
you may then include a [name]_mouth.png and a [name]_eyes.png if desired.
positioning these in game is (currently) done through the use of the [name].meta file.
the provided example should be enough to help you determine how to set this up.

STATIC characters are simply a single png file titled [name].png
there is nothing more to say about them



ALSO!
The player sprite is determined by the player's trainer type!
