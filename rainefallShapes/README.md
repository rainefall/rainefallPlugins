# rainefallShapes
Primitive drawing library for mkxp-z

Supports drawing untextured (solid colour) and textured circles, ellipses, triangles and convex n-gons. Fast enough to draw a couple of shapes per frame as long as they're not too big. Just be mindful and definitely don't try to write a software renderer with this (that's my job)
